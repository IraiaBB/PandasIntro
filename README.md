- **Tools**     
This tutorial-style project is done in Jupyter Notebook, using [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/).

A project in Jupyter Notebook is divided in different cells, which contain code and can be compiled independently. A cell, besides of code can contain markdown language, which is
useful for text explanations.     

- **Organization**     
Before every peace of code there's a simple explanation of what it's been done below. Each statement it's isolated in a cell, so it can be compiled separately from the others.
That means that cells have to be moved and selected. For doing this it is important to know some shortcuts.
