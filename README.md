# Pandas Introduction     

This folder contains an introduction to Pandas' dataframes.     

- **Tools**     
This tutorial-style project is done in Jupyter Notebook, using [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/).

A project in Jupyter Notebook is divided in different cells, which contain code and can be compiled independently. A cell, besides of code can contain markdown language, which is
useful for text explanations.     

- **Organization**     
Before every peace of code there's a simple explanation of what it's been done below. Each statement it's isolated in a cell, so it can be compiled separately from the others.
That means that cells have to be moved and selected. For doing this it is important to know some shortcuts.    

- **Keyboard shortcuts**    
In the top of the notebook, below the searcher of the navigator, there's the typical menu with a few drop-down submenus. The last one is *Help*, where the
keyboard shorcut options are. One is to know which shortcut belongs to the action we want to perform, and the other to edit them.

A cell is selected by clicking on it, outside the code box. A selected cell has a blue thick line in its right side. If it's green means that the code box was clicked to
change or create some code.

Once selected the cell we can manipulate it. To select more than one cell, they have to be adjacent. Search for the keyboard shortcut called *extend selected cells above*
or below. Usually this would be `Shift-Up` or `Shift-Down`, but it can be changed. To run multiple cells this is indispensable. Have in mind that the cells will be
compiled in the same order as they are in the notebook, so the `print()` must lay below the operations.
To change the position of a cell, search for the shortcut option *move selected cells up* or down. In this way, there's no need to run all the cells.
